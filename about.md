## About

This application was developed by [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](https://twitter.com/lucystats) based on Emily Oster's curated data.

### About the data

#### What is this? Where can I learn more?	

This is crowd-sourced data collection effort spearheaded by the team at [COVID-Explained](https://explaincovid.org), and [Emily Oster](https://emilyoster.net) at Brown Unversity. You can find details about the data collection [here](https://explaincovid.org/kids/covid-19-and-children-our-crowd-sourced-data/).
	
#### Is the data collection random?	

No; institutions volunteer to be part of this.  

#### What kind of locations are you collecting data from?

We are collecting data from all child care settings: home care, formal child care centers, camps, schools and others.  The age range is birth through 18. We include any location which reports their total population is 5 or more children when full.
	
#### How can I use this document?

There is a summary page, which we produce based on the data we have. We've pulled out separately camps, large locations and hot spots (for now).  In addition: we provide all the raw data.  You can download the entire data set in the "Search dataset" tab.  You can also filter to look at particular states or care types or age groups and download the filtered data.
	
#### How can I get my institution in here?	

Please fill out the baseline survey in the "Add to the database" tab!
