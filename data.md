This dataset is crowdsourced ongoing tracking data on child settings -- child care, camp, schools -- which are open or reopening soon. This data will be tracked by week. It is hard to evaluate biases here, but our guess is that this somewhat understates COVID-19 cases since children without symptoms are not reported here. As we get more data, or push to more systematic sampling, we hope this will improve. We are also tracking outbreaks that have been reported in the media [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZOl1sNMToNCmQZSobV1-lmMJX5ER-Lrx-0Khv8O8AN0/edit#gid=0). For more information, visit the "About" tab in the Navigation pane.
